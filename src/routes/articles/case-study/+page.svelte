<h2>Client: (confidential)</h2>
<p>Problem: put a pricing spreadsheet online for clients to use.</p>
<p>
	Details: 20 rows of data and unlimited columns with monthly budgets. Interactive dynamic graphs
	that show the effects of what-if scenarios.
</p>
<p>
	Solution: Svelte used for the frontend application with a simple form to identify and lock in
	client type, fully interactive spreadsheet using a data-table and inherent calculations that
	propagated across the columns of the spreadsheet and a chart dynamically.
</p>
<p>Time engaged: 5 hours programming time, accelerated by AI use.</p>
<p>Result: App hosted on youronline.app domain for immediate testing <strong>the next day</strong> for client.</p>
<p>
	Cost: £500.00. Additional changes may require additional costs. Client required some simple
	changes and they took another 2 hours. Each revision tested and published in less than 30 seconds.
    When Client approved, installed it on their own domain taking more time.

<h2>Alternative</h2>
<p>Enterprise Development (Productised Service)</p>
<p>Cost: US$4000/month</p>
<p>
	The above project would be completed, modifications and adjustments made during the month, plus
	other projects completed.
</p>
<p>
	Comparison: Client would get more value for their project, plus additional projects and websites
	during the month. The above client would have only invested approximately £150 for the above application development 
    and most importantly received a more capable application.
