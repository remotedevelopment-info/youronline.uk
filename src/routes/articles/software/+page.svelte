<h2>YourOnline Software</h2>
<p>
	YourOnline software is available for enterprise. We charge a flat rate per month. It is more
	economic than hiring a full time developer and can scale according to your urgency and budget.
</p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>
	An initial meeting to scope your project and what may be required can arrive at a timeframe for
	implementation. We are experts at AI powered development and can delivery full stack online
	applications rapidly.
</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>
	We like to work closely with your team or assigned point of contact, with daily meetings
	available, or an online chat session to announce release versions.
</p>
<h2>Your own your code</h2>
<p>
	All Code is shared with you via an online private repository (Github or a privately hosted
	repository), and a staging website under the youronline.app domain means instant publishing and
	feedback.
</p>
<p>
	We charge a flat monthly rate as the scope of a project most often changes as the project
	progresses. Your costs are predictable and your code is available to you at all times.
</p>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>
	We can deliver projects in a variety of programming frameworks and languages. We prefer the
	Laravel Stack for backend development and the fast Svelte or VueJS frameworks for frontend.
    However clients may have projects in progress using other frameworks or languages for which 
    we can provide support, managing external teams.
