<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<h3>YourOnline.UK Services</h3>
<div class="terms">
	<ol>
		<li>
			Services are provided on a contractual basis.  This set of terms outlines the basis of our contract with you.
		</li>
		<li>
			Software development requires an understanding of your requirements. We will meet with you to discuss your requirements.
		</li>
		<li>
			We will provide an estimate for the work required to achieve your requirements. 
		</li>
		<li>
			We meet with you periodically to assess progress and accept new requirements that may extend the production scope of the project.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are three parts to every project: 
			<ul>
				<li>Dev Ops engineering - publishing work to repositories and servers</li>
				<li>Frontend Development - design, styling and content publishing</li>
				<li>Backend Development - databases, security and modules that store and change data</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			We will provide you with a subdomain to approve work in progress.  Progress will be posted to this site for your review.
			For frontend sites, we can usually provide updates on a daily basis.
		</li>
		<li>
			We can provide a domain name and configure it on your behalf. Or we can advise you on DNS settings for you to configure in your domain registry.
		</li>
		<li>
			We can provide hosting on cloud servers. Software developed is available in a GitHub private repository that you can 
			access and implement on your own servers.  We may provide a staging server to test and approve the next version prerelease.
		</li>
		<li>
			Initial engagement requires an agreement in an Email to info@softwareantelope.com.  Intial engagement is normally 
			paid in advance before work commences.  We will provide you with a contract to sign and invoice for payment.
		</li>
		<li>
			Established clients may continue to be billed on a monthly or weekly basis. Payment of invoices on agreed terms.
		</li>
		<li>
			Software development is delivered on a client acceptance basis. We will also provide a suite of tests to verify that 
			the software continues to work as each update is published on the staging server. We expect a 100% test pass rate.
		</li>
		<li>
			Software tests are part of the development process.  Bug discovery and resolution is part of the development process.
			No warrenty is provided for bugs after the software is published so it is important to test the software.  Our developers 
			will test software at a functional level, and test the software functions as expected.  
		</li>
		<li>
			We can not accept liability for software that fails to match expectations, but any bugs that are reported will be addressed 
			with urgency.  Bugs must be reported on writing via the supplied chat support and/or email.
		</li>
